## HACTOBER FIESTA 2022 PORTFOLIO SETUP

# INITIAL SETUP
- 1. Have a photo of yours ready in 1:1 ratio. To make it in 1:1 ratio edit the photo and select the crop icon. From there select the square icon, this ensures your photo is in 1:1 ratio.
- 2. Install [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download),[NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/),[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and have an account in [Github](https://github.com/)


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
